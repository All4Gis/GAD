Geographic Aided Design - Professional Drawing Tools for SIG.
----------

The purpose of this fork is to bring Professional Drawing Tools for GIS software (like QGIS). In this idea we want to organize and build a code more flexible and modular to help the usage of commun drawing tools dispite the software license, so drawers or engineers are used to the same commands.

Our main objectif:
- Rebuild the plugin so it's more easy to integrate with core functions of differents Software Licenses

The others objectifs we want to achieve are:
- Create more python objects for the QT and PyQGIS objects and integrate it in a QGIS module
- Separete commands from the code so we can use core functions from the software
- Create dynamic commands easy to configure in the IHM (Export / Import Configuration)
- Use only SVG format as image format
